The plugin has different structures depending on the type of trigger for the build. Each of the following sample configurations is the minimum needed for their respective trigger type.

### Manual Configuration

module.exports = ({ env }) => ({
 'website-builder': {
    enabled: true,
    config: {
      url: 'https://link-to-hit-on-trigger.com',
      trigger: {
        type: 'manual',
      },
    }
  },
});
```

### Cron/Periodic Configuration

```javascript
module.exports = ({ env }) => ({
 'website-builder': {
    enabled: true,
    config: {
      url: 'https://link-to-hit-on-trigger.com',
      trigger: {
        type: 'cron',
        cron: '* * 1 * * *',
      },
    }
  },
});
```

### Event Configuration

```javascript

      url: 'https://link-to-hit-on-trigger.com',
      trigger: {

          },
